The goal of this project is that published and approved CEST saturation blocks 
are made available in the open  standard 
<a href="https://pulseq.github.io/" target="_blank"><i>Pulseq</i></a> standard. <br>
This allows exact comparison of CEST saturation blocks with newly developed or adapted
saturation blocks for reproducible CEST research. <br>
In addition we provide an open source Bloch-McConnell simulation which allows for simulation of the
saturation blocks.
