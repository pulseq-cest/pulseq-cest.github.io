Welcome to the <strong><i>Pulseq</i>-CEST</strong> project page!<br><br>

The goal of this project is that published and approved CEST saturation blocks 
are made available in the open  standard 
<a href="https://pulseq.github.io/" target="_blank"><i>Pulseq</i></a> standard. <br>
This allows exact comparison of CEST saturation blocks with newly developed or adapted
saturation blocks for reproducible CEST research. <br>
In addition we provide an open source Bloch-McConnell simulation which allows for simulation of the
saturation blocks.</p> <br>

Get started with either the <a href="https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest">MATLAB</a> or
 <a href="https://github.com/KerstinHut/pypulseq-cest">python</a> version.
